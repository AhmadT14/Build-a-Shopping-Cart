# Shopping Cart 🛒

As part of **Udacity's Intro to Programming Nanodegree**, I contributed to building a **Shopping Cart** application using **JavaScript**, specifically focusing on the `script.js` file. This project strengthened my **JavaScript skills**, emphasizing **dynamic item management** through **arrays, objects, and functions**.

## Features 🚀
- **Add, Remove, and Update Items:** Handled dynamic item management in the cart.
- **Calculate Totals:** Implemented functionality to update cart total automatically.
- **Loops & Conditionals:** Used for iterating through items and applying logic.
- **Debugging & Optimization:** Ensured smooth functionality by debugging the script.
